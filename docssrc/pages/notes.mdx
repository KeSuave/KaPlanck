# Notes

Here are few notes that I believe worth to be aware of while using this library.

- While using the events: [onKPCollide](/api/interfaces/KaPlanckPluginCtx#onkpcollide),
[onKPCollideEnd](/api/interfaces/KaPlanckPluginCtx#onkpcollideend), and
[onKPCollideUpdate](/api/interfaces/KaPlanckPluginCtx#onkpcollideupdate)
please remember that you should not destroy any game object, instead try to use the helper function
[addToDestroyList](/api/interfaces/KPWorldComp#addtodestroylist) from the `kpWorld` component.

- Bodies, fixtures, joints have the [KPUserData](/api/interfaces/KPUserData) attached to them incase you need
to access their respective game object.

- If your bodies have multiple fixtures, I recommend to create a game object with `kpBody` and add children
with the shapes and fixtures.

```ts
const player = worldContainer.add([
  k.kpPos(),
  k.kpRotate(),
  k.kpBody()
]);

player.add([
  k.kpBoxShape({ width: 1, height: 1 }),
  k.kpFixture()
]);

player.add([
  k.kpCircleShape({ radius: 0.5 }),
  k.kpFixture()
])
```

- The previous method can also be applied to things like sprites and other non-physics related components.
