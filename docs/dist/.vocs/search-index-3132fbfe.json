Happy coding!</p>","isPage":false,"text":"\nThe following assumes you already have a KaPlay project set up.\nLets create our own version of &quot;Hello World&quot; using KaPlanck.\nLets start by importing our dependencies and add a KaPlay instance:\n// 1. Import modules.\nimport KaPlanckPlugin from &quot;kaplanck&quot;;\nimport kaplay from &quot;kaplay&quot;;\nimport { Vec2 } from &quot;planck&quot;;\n \n// 2. Create a new KaPlay instance.\nconst k = kaplay({\n  global: false,\n  plugins: [KaPlanckPlugin()], \n});\nAs shown, adding the plugin to KaPlay is as easy as adding the highlighted line.\nNext, let us add a world container (a game object that holds our physics world):\n// 1. Import modules.\nimport KaPlanckPlugin from &quot;kaplanck&quot;;\nimport kaplay from &quot;kaplay&quot;;\nimport { Vec2 } from &quot;planck&quot;;\n \n// 2. Create a new KaPlay instance.\nconst k = kaplay({\n  global: false,\n  plugins: [KaPlanckPlugin()],\n});\n \n// 3. Add a world container with gravity set to x: 0 y: 10.\nconst worldContainer = k.add([ \n  k.kpWorld({ \n    gravity: new Vec2(0, 10), \n  }), \n]); \nNote that Vec2 is from Planck and not from KaPlay.\nNow that we have our world container set up, let&#x27;s add a ground to it.\nWe can do this by creating a static body with an edge shape:\n// 1. Import modules.\nimport KaPlanckPlugin from &quot;kaplanck&quot;;\nimport kaplay from &quot;kaplay&quot;;\nimport { Vec2 } from &quot;planck&quot;;\n \n// 2. Create a new KaPlay instance.\nconst k = kaplay({\n  global: false,\n  plugins: [KaPlanckPlugin()],\n});\n \n// 3. Add a world container with gravity set to x: 0 y: 10.\nconst worldContainer = k.add([\n  k.kpWorld({\n    gravity: new Vec2(0, 10),\n  }),\n]);\n \n// 4. Add ground by creating a static body with an edge shape.\nworldContainer.add([ \n  k.kpPos(k.kpCenter()), \n  k.kpRotate(Math.PI * 0.1), \n  k.kpEdgeShape({ \n    v1: new Vec2(-10, 0), \n    v2: new Vec2(10, 0), \n    draw: true, \n  }), \n  k.kpBody({ \n    type: &quot;static&quot;, \n  }), \n  k.kpFixture(), \n]); \nAgain, note that here we are using kpPos and kpRotate instead of pos and rotate.\nFinally, let&#x27;s add a simple ball to the world. We can do this by creating a dynamic body with a circle shape:\n// 1. Import modules.\nimport KaPlanckPlugin from &quot;kaplanck&quot;;\nimport kaplay from &quot;kaplay&quot;;\nimport { Vec2 } from &quot;planck&quot;;\n \n// 2. Create a new KaPlay instance.\nconst k = kaplay({\n  global: false,\n  plugins: [KaPlanckPlugin()],\n});\n \n// 3. Add a world container with gravity set to x: 0 y: 10.\nconst worldContainer = k.add([\n  k.kpWorld({\n    gravity: new Vec2(0, 10),\n  }),\n]);\n \n// 4. Add ground by creating a static body with an edge shape.\nworldContainer.add([\n  k.kpPos(k.kpCenter()),\n  k.kpRotate(Math.PI * 0.1),\n  k.kpEdgeShape({\n    v1: new Vec2(-10, 0),\n    v2: new Vec2(10, 0),\n    draw: true,\n  }),\n  k.kpBody({\n    type: &quot;static&quot;,\n  }),\n  k.kpFixture(),\n]);\n \n// 5. Add a ball by creating a dynamic body with a circle shape.\nworldContainer.add([ \n  k.kpPos(k.kpCenter().sub({ x: k.rand(-10, 10), y: k.rand(10, 15) })), \n  k.kpRotate(), \n  k.kpCircleShape({ \n    radius: 1, \n    draw: true, \n  }), \n  k.kpBody({ type: &quot;dynamic&quot; }), \n  k.kpFixture({ density: 1, friction: 0.3 }), \n  k.offscreen({ destroy: true }), \n]); \nI know this is not the most complex example, but it demonstrates a basic setup using KaPlay and Planck for creating a physics-based games.\nWell with that being said, hope this plugin helps you get started with building physics-based games or interactive applications!\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
